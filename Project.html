      <h1>JavaScript Project!</h1>
      <p>In this project, I will be building a generic website that will seem to ask mundane questions to normal users, but I secretly am looking for a spy! Anyone visiting my website will be asked a series of questions, only the Spy will be able to give specific answers I expect. If all questions are answered correctly, I will post a secret message in the console for the Spy to read!</p>
      <p>Here are the four conditions you will check for the spy: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Spy has the same first letter of her First Name and Last Name </li>
        <li>The Spy is between the age of 20 and 30 (exclusive of 20 and 30) </li>
        <li>The Spy is at least 170 centimeters tall. </li>
        <li>The Spy has a pet name that ends with the letter "y" </li>
      </ul>
        <p>Used Javascript to prompt the user for information and set these to variables. Then use these variables to check for the four conditions to be true. </p>
        <p>A spy with the following information should see my secret message.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Jose Johnson </li>
        <li>26 years old </li>
        <li>175 cm tall</li>
        <li>Pet name is 'Sammy'</li>
      </ul>
